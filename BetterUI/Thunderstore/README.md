## Features

### ItemCounters
Customizable ItemCounters. Choose which tiers you want counted, choose which tiers to show.  
Use ItemScore to not just see how many items you have but how good they are.
By default item score is based on tiers, but you can change how much each tier is worth or even set custom values for each item!

### BuffTimers & Tooltips
Buff timers currently only work if you are the host because the timers are not networked in multiplayer.

Integration with ItemStats in the command and scrapper windows.

## Configuration

#### StatsDisplay

The StatsDisplay parses the `StatString` in the config file and replaces all the parameters it finds.
The StatsDisplay can also be moved, resized and recolored and formatted ( See: http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/ )  
If you want another parameter added, feel free to suggest it to me (See Help & Feedback)
Here is a list of all valid parameters right now

$exp $level $luck  
$dmg $crit $luckcrit $atkspd  
$hp $maxhp $shield $maxshield $barrier $maxbarrier  
$armor $armordmgreduction $regen  
$movespeed $jumps $maxjumps  
$killcount $multikill $highestmultikill  
$dps $dpscharacter $dpsminions  
$mountainshrines  
$blueportal $goldportal $celestialportal  

#### Sorting

You can enable/disable any part of the mod in the config file.  
The sorting is completely customizable as well. 
The default sorting value is **S134**

**S** means the items are first sorted by the "Scrap" tag and all the scrap is put at the end of the list.  
**1** then sorts it by tier, in descending order, putting higher tier items at the front. 
**3** sorts it by the stack size in descending order, meaning if you have more of an item, it will come first. 
**4** then sorts it by pickup order, meaning items you got first, come first. 

You can customize this in any way you like.

The full options:

0 = Tier Ascending  
1 = Tier Descending  
2 = Stack Size Ascending  
3 = Stack Size Descending  
4 = Pickup Order  
5 = Pickup Order Reversed  
6 = Alphabetical  
7 = Alphabetical Reversed  
8 = Random   
i = ItemIndex  
I = ItemIndex Descending  

Tag Based:  

s = Scrap First  
S = Scrap Last  
d = Damage First  
D = Damage Last  
h = Healing First  
H = Healing Last  
u = Utility First  
U = Utility Last  
o = On Kill Effect First  
O = On Kill Effect Last  
e = Equipment Related First  
E = Equipment Related Last  
p = Sprint Related First  
P = Sprint Related Last  

## Changelog

### v1.6.0
 - New Feature: Item Counters: Fully customizable. Simple counting of items, groups by tier or item score by tier or even individual items
 - New Feature: Skill cooldowns: Base cooldown & calculated cooldown in the tooltip. Base cooldown in the loadout screen.

#### v1.5.7
 - Addition: Added $difficulty parameter to display the Difficulty Coefficient in the StatsDisplay
 - Addition: Added the ability to change the custom bind for showing/changing the StatsDisplay, by default it replaces the old Scoreboard bind.
 - Addition: Added the Proc Coefficient information to the loadout screen.
 - Change: Replaced $crit with $luckcrit in the StatString, added both and $difficulty to StatStringCustomBind 
 - Bugfix: Fixed $luckcrit not working. 
 - Notes: The custom bind changes will reset your StatStringScoreboard because it was moved to a different config variable. It felt wrong to keep the same name when it is no longer tied to the scoreboard directly.

#### v1.5.6
 - Bugfix: Added formatting for more numbers in StatsDisplay
 - Internal Change: more changes to allow modders to more easily register their items for display in skill tooltips

#### v1.5.5
 - Oops: Removed debug console spam from FINALLY FIXING THIS BUG YAY anyways sorry 

#### v1.5.4
 - Bugfix: ACTUAL fix that fixes issues with scrapper/command sorting in multiplayer

#### v1.5.3
 - Bugfix: Made a change that could *potentially* fix issues with scrapper/command sorting in multiplayer

#### v1.5.2
 - Internal Change: Changed the way skills are registered to allow makers of custom skills to more easily register their skills. 

#### v1.5.1
 - Bugfix: Fixed a few incorrect proc coefficient values. 

### v1.5.0

 - New Feature: Skills and equipment show the cooldown remaining even if you can have multiple stacks. 
 - New Feature: Ability to disable pickup notifications for items/equipemnts/artifacts
 - Bugfix Scrapper window no longer shows before/after ItemStatsIntegration text, only the normal one.
 - Bugfix $luckcrit now works correctly
 - Bugfix Fixed a bug with command windows if sorting was enabled on the scrapper window but not the command window
 - Note: Some default options have been changed, such as the default command sorting not changing the item order anymore because it was found to be disruptive. I encourage everyone to look back at features they might've previously disabled because it's possible they have been improved since then. 
 - Note: If you want something added to the mod feel free to create an issue on GitHub, many features and options for the StatsDisplay were added because they were requested. 

#### v1.4.4
 - Fixed command bug when picking equipment due to leftover code and hook typo

#### v1.4.3
 - undid the debug code i pushed on accident that locked all items in command. 

#### v1.4.2

 - Changed default command sortorder to "6" ( Alphabetical ). I believe that sorting that changes the order in the command window during a run leads to more confusion than it helps.
 - Fixed some small mistakes with config values and hooks
 - Moved command sorting optionmap application to OnCreateButton to remove an unnecesary hook and attempt to improve compatibility with mods that call SubmitChoice directly
 - Rewrote DPSMeter calculations for performance
 - Rewrote StatsDisplay StatsString parser for performance

 - This was added by request, if you want anything else added to the StatsDisplay, please just let me know. 

#### v1.3.1
 - Fixed CommandCountersHideOnZero not showing tooltips without counters

### v1.3.0
 - Clientside DPS Meter
 - StatsDisplay can now list DPS
 - StatsDisplay can now attach to the objective panel to automatically move out of the way

 - ItemStatsMod integration for the command and scrapper window
 - Many of these changes were directly requested so feel free to make suggestions to me on discord or on github.
