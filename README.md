# BetterUI

## Do not try to fork this Repo to bring back old versions of the mod, they will be taken down. 

A mod that makes the UI better by adding a nice little button to the main menu

All other features of BetterUI have been removed. 

This change was made due to continued harrassment from a part of the RoR2 Modding community and Thunderstore's lack of action regarding these spite-fueled individuals.
