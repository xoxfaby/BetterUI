## Configuration

#### StatsDisplay

The StatsDisplay parses the `StatString` in the config file and replaces all the parameters it finds.
The StatsDisplay can also be moved, resized and recolored and formatted ( See: http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/ )  
If you want another parameter added, feel free to suggest it to me (See Help & Feedback)
Here is a list of all valid parameters right now

$exp $level $luck  
$dmg $crit $luckcrit $atkspd  
$hp $maxhp $shield $maxshield $barrier $maxbarrier  
$armor $armordmgreduction $regen  
$movespeed $jumps $maxjumps  
$killcount $multikill $highestmultikill  
$dps $dpscharacter $dpsminions  
$mountainshrines  
$blueportal $goldportal $celestialportal  

#### Sorting

The sorting is completely customizable.
The default sorting value is **S134**

**S** means the items are first sorted by the "Scrap" tag and all the scrap is put at the end of the list.  
**1** then sorts it by tier, in descending order, putting higher tier items at the front.
**3** sorts it by the stack size in descending order, meaning if you have more of an item, it will come first.
**4** then sorts it by pickup order, meaning items you got first, come first.

You can customize this in any way you like.

Filters:

\# + a tag will apply the next sorting to only items that match the tag.  
You can use any tags from the tag based sorting.   
Examples:  
`#s0` to sort scrap by tier ascending.  
`#t14#t28` to sort Tier 1 items by pickup order and tier 2 items randomly.

The full options:

0 = Tier Ascending  
1 = Tier Descending  
2 = Stack Size Ascending  
3 = Stack Size Descending  
4 = Pickup Order  
5 = Pickup Order Reversed  
6 = Alphabetical  
7 = Alphabetical Reversed  
8 = Random   
i = ItemIndex  
I = ItemIndex Descending  

Tag Based:  

s = Scrap First  
S = Scrap Last  
d = Damage First  
D = Damage Last  
h = Healing First  
H = Healing Last  
u = Utility First  
U = Utility Last  
o = On Kill Effect First  
O = On Kill Effect Last  
e = Equipment Related First  
E = Equipment Related Last  
p = Sprint Related First  
P = Sprint Related Last  

t1 = Tier 1 First
t2 = Tier 2 First
t3 = Tier 3 First
tL = Lunar Tier First
tB = Boss Tier First
tN = NoTier First

T1 = Tier 1 Last
T2 = Tier 2 Last
T3 = Tier 3 Last
TL = Lunar Tier Last
TB = Boss Tier Last
TN = NoTier Last

Single Items:  
You can position specific items by specifying their internal name, using angle brackets to specify where.  
Examples:  
`s<(RegeneratingScrap)134` to place all scrap first, then regenerating scrap, then the rest of your items as normal.  
`>(Behemoth)S134` to always place the brillant behemoth last, then the rest of your items as normal.
